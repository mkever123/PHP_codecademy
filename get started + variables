$a = 6 / 3;
// The variable $a will hold an integer value, since the operation evaluates to a whole number.
 
$b = 7 / 3;
// The variable $b will hold a floating point value, since the operation evaluates to a decimal number.
$a = 9 % 2.3;
//2.3 is converted to the integer, 2. The remainder of 9 % 2 is 1. So the variable $a will hold the integer value 1.
 
$b = -19 % 4;
//The remainder of this operation is -3. So the variable $b will hold the integer value -3.
 
$c = 20 % 2;
//The remainder of this operation is 0. So the variable $c will hold the integer value 0.
